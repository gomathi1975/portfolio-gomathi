<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Let me introduce myself in 7 words. Responsible, creative, open-minded, friendly and ambitious web developer. This is how I see myself, and hope will get a chance to prove myself in this job.</p>

<p>Except of my work, which is my greatest passion, I enjoy spending time with small kids.</p>

<p>I have been working in Savemyexams (Uk based) with some supportive and excellent collegues. I'm a dedicated administrative supporter with a passion for organization and teamwork. In addition to my professional role, I'm a proud parent of two wonderful kids. At 48 years old, I value every moment of life's journey and continue to learn and grow every day </p>
